# Standard Deck Shuffler
#### This library's primary use is for the mechanics involved with keeping a mathematically accurate deck of cards. Some of these features are a WIP.

### Overview/Features:

- It creates and shuffles both single and double decks, and emulates common dealer shuffling practices such as the [**Riffle Shuffle**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riffle_shuffle_permutation) (Alternatively, P,Q shuffles can be enabled, a variation of the Riffle Shuffle) and different variations of [**Cuts**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut_(cards))

- Washes are emulated by "Throwing away" the current deck and preshuffling a new one.

- Ability to both deal, [second deal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_dealing), and [bottom deal] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottom_dealing) from the deck

- Top and Bottom Peeking of Cards

- Single and Double decks are supported (52 or 104)

- Functional game mechanics, such as Discard Piles and [Community Cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_card_poker)
